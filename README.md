###### Technologies

For this applicationn I have used react for front end development,
Redux for the state management tool and
Firebase for API operations

###### The way of running the application

After settings up all libraries that need to have run the command 'npm start'

Then it will navigate to registartion page.

After registering then need to login by giving relavent credentials

After succesful login it will navigate to Homepage which is displays the produts.

Then loggedin user can get details of each items by clicking `View` button which is riderect to the productinfo page

Or loggedin user can add each items to their cart by clicking `ADD TO CART` button.

The users can view their cart by clicking the `cart` icon on the navigation bar of the Homepage

And any already loggedin user can logout from the system by clicking the `logout` on the navigation bar of Homepage.
After loginout from the system it will redirect to the login page.

This application can be accessed by only for loggedin users. Because all routers are protected.
